//explain what is graph?
// =>nodes and their interconnection
//compare and contrast diff type of graph and their use cases in real world
//=>social Network,Mapping ,routing,visual hierarchy,file system optimization

// vertex=>a node
// edge=>connection between edges
//directed/undirected graph => polarity/direction of edge 
// weight/nonweighted=>edge with value is weighted graph.

//implement a graph using an adjancency list.
// =>adjency matrix ,adjency graph
//traverse BY BFS and DFS.
